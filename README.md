# Bike_Share_Project

In this project, I use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I Wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
